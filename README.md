# NHLShiftsStats3
## Background
Original repo is located at https://github.com/umnovjp/NHLShiftStats3. It was working in 98% of games. But with NHL changing its APIs without any announcement I realized that it was better to start new repo from scratch instead of fixing original one. One of the reasons is that trying to fix issues with original repo created too many new hurdles. Like fixing one led to a new one. And as script progressed, I knew I am on the right path after 2 years of JavaScript experience. What I could not accomplish with 1200 lines of code last year, I did with just 400 lines. Compare script.js files! Another NHL stats repo https://github.com/umnovjp/NHLShiftStats1 will be easier to fix.
## Usage
First thing is to select a date. And remember to select date when games actually were played. ![calendar](image.png) 
Then you will be prompted to select a game. Press one button to select a game. ![select a game](image-1.png) Separate tables will be displayed for home and away team defensemen. ![Alt text](image-2.png) You can easy determine defensive pairs from this table. It is not that easy for forward lines. Because lines of three forwards are not that easy to display in a 2D table. This is how it is done currently. ![Alt text](image-4.png). There are two tables look at top one. Second one is under test. Also, special teams are frequently played with 2 or 4 forwards depending on, depending if it is penalty kill or power play. This script limits 5x5 play as play with 2D and 3F only. This is done to exclude PP with 4F and 1 D, and sometimes playes where D comes out of penalty box where his team plays with 3D and 2F till next stoppage. Still it includes PP with 3F and 2D, which is usually second PP unit. 

Definition of shift is 10 seconds pair of defensmen or trio of forwards played continuously at the same time.
## Notes
I tried maybe 30-40 different algorithms to come up with reasonable lines combinations. There are 32 teams in NHL. And each of them has its own defensive system. Next, each game is different. Player may be injured in 1st period or may get a game misconduct. There may be multiple penalties resulting in limited 5x5 play. This algorithm works for virtually every game. And if it does not, I will add a list of games where it does not work.

## Known Failures and Comments (those will be deleted later)
Some game data are not displayed correctly because of obvious errors in NHL API data. Example is STL at FLA game on 12/21/2023 where data for many shifts are duplicated. Similar example is TOR at CBJ game on 12/23/2023 where many shifts are duplicated while some non existing overlapping shifts are added. Game CBJ at NJD on 12/28/2023 generated unreliable results for DMen because there were 3 of them on ice frequently. Most likely one D(#2?) was dressed as an F. Not sure if this paragraph is still relevant. on 1/21 game 0 H lines are incorrect because #11 played on 2 lines. game 0 on 01/29 12 F but only 11 displayednt game report still counts him as D. Game 4 on 01/09 A has 3 lines only with 12F. Game 1 on 1/14 only 3 h lines are displayed because 3 played on 2 lines. game 8 on 1/15 only 3 lines displayed. game 6 on 1/16 determines lines correctly. but toi .

11F playing in 3 or 4 lines 5 times in January and 3 or more times in December and once in November. Currently game 3 on 01/04 displays 4 lines because H team had 7 Ds but #71 belongs to 2 lines. Game 3 on 01/04 11F but #71 played on 2 lines. on 1/22  game 3 H team 11F #9 played on 2 lines. game 3 on 1/18 #11 played on two lines for 11F home team. Game 9 on 1/13 A has 3 lines with 7D. Game 6 on 12/29 11F but 4 lines. game 9 on 12/9 displays #13, #96, #29 all playing on two lines. Game 12 on 12/7 #15 played on two lines. Game 7 on 11/2 11F but 4 lines displayed with #29 on 2 lines. Will add October games here. No games so far in October

Example of 2 line game is game 2 02/12. Example of 1 line game 9 on 01/02. both work well now.

Game 1 05/08: 0 lines defined for H team also game 1 05/10 and game 1 5/12 same thing game 1 5/14, 5/14 same thing because nhle web API does not have any data for those 3 games. game 0 5/12 H team 3rd period because no lines played 100s so far finished 05/19 trying to find that bug

10/19 7 empty; 10/15 0022 52; 03/28 game 5 1200 50; game 7 3/26 0022 52; game 1 3/25 0202 40; game 4 3/23 1200 50; game 5 3/23 0202 40 3 lines detected; game 3 3/16 4 check; game 2 3/11 0021 51 check; 3/2 game 6 51 check; game 0 3/2 127 51 check; game 11 10/26 team 1 period 2 8911 045 267 3 lines detected; game 3 10/28 team 0 period 1 2810 459 017 check, game 7 10/28 team 1 period 1 059 21011 136 478 check, game 1 10/29 team 0 period 0 1210 049 357 check; game 2 10/29 team 1 period 1 0511 1710 238 check; game 1 11/19 team 1 period 2 3 lines detected but not 4th all thre resolved

game 1 11/3 4th line all zeros. Also line 017 played 24 sec for 4 shifts which could not happen, game 1 10/29 70 sec played 14 shifts

game 0,1,2 10/20 all empty games 10/21, 10/22 as well it works again 10/24 tested up to end of 11/3 all works

game 6 12/14 away team has lines changing. but home team has order of lines changing. Game 3 1/25 away team lines change game 8 1/25 both teams changes lines. game 9 1/25 away team changed lines. game 10 1/25 away team changed lines. game 11 1/25 home team no line change but console has message. game 12 1/15 all lines have the same order no new lines. seems that if lines order changes it counts as a new line

lines 411-419 new lines, old lines, then 421-452 for home and away, that includes 431-452 away adding to the screen. then 456-459 then function lineNumber 461-466 which i do not use

game stars sharks 02/08 away team 2 lines change. game 5 02/25 away team chnged all 4 lines.
